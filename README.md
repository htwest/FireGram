FIREGRAM

This is an app meant to replicate Instagram like functionaliy by allowing a user to view and upload images.

Images are loaded from the database and rendered onpage in a grid format. Clicking on an image brings up an expanded modal to view the image in it's original resolution. By clicking on the + icon, a user will be able to upload an image file to the database, where it will then automatically appear on page.

The App is built using Next.js, and uses Firebase as a back end database to store image files. Additional animations are provided by the Framer-Motions package.
